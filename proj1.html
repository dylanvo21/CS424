        <img src = "1980S02.PNG">
        <p>There are no hazardous Days but almost half would be considered unhealthy for sensitive people But there are higher number of days where SO2 was the lead pollutant</p>
        </div>

            <img src = "1990Chart.PNG">
            <img src ="1990Table.PNG">
            <p>SO2 appears to be relevant still however there are less unhealthy days during this time</p>
        </div>

            <img src ="2000PM2.5.PNG">
            <p>Around the early 2000s we see a turn in which pollutant becomes more popular. The days of moderate levels are higher but the good days are reduced</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>2005</h2>
            <img src ="2005Table.PNG">
            <p>SO2 has significantly decreased compared to PM2.5</p>
        </div>

            <h2>2010</h2>
            <img src ="2010Chart.PNG">
            <img src ="2010TableDay.PNG">
            <p>The days have shifted to a moderate quality of air and nearly eradicated every unhealthy. Perhaps a big envirment awareness movement happened</p>
        </div>

            <h2>2018</h2>
            <img src="2018Chart.PNG">
            <img src="2018Table.PNG">
            <p>Ozone seems to be catching up to PM2.5 in Cook COunty and compared to 2010 there number of moderate quality days decreased. Ozone could play a significant factor in air quality</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Analysis</h2>
            <p>Overall, air quality seems to improve over time however that could change depending on how severe ozone could become. It also seems that SO2 has become a very minor chemical in air today.</p>
